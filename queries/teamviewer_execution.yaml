description: "Identifies potentially malicious processes masquerading as legitimate TeamViewer software on non-Linux systems. It flags execution events where the binary claims to be signed by \"TeamViewer Germany GmbH\" but fails digital signature validation. This discrepancy indicates an adversary is likely using a spoofed or tampered executable to evade security controls."
